# Social Media Analysis: Google Data Analytics Certification Capstone Project

The Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone project is a case study. The program offered two tracks that offered either a case study provided by the program or the option to create our own. I created my own since this was my first project and I wanted the practice. This is a mock scenario and a made-up company.

The project covers each step of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.

## Scenario

You are a junior data analyst and have been asked to lead a project for a brand new client - this will involve everything from defining the business task all the way through presenting your data-driven recommendations. You will choose the topic, ask the right questions, identify a dataset and ensure its integrity, conduct analysis, create compelling data visualizations, and prepare a presentation.

### About the Company

SocialTech Enterprises, Inc. is a prominent technology company specializing in social media platforms and online communities. Founded a decade ago by entrepreneur Sarah Mitchell, the company has been at the forefront of providing innovative digital solutions to connect people worldwide. With a user base exceeding millions, the company's platforms have played a significant role in shaping online interactions and the way people communicate in the digital age.
Recently, SocialTech Enterprises has been facing increasing scrutiny and public concern over the potential impact of their platforms on users' mental health and well-being. There have been media reports, academic studies, and user feedback suggesting that prolonged engagement with their platforms may contribute to issues such as anxiety, low self-esteem, and even symptoms of ADHD and depression.

Amidst these concerns, Sarah Mitchell, the CEO of SocialTech Enterprises, has taken a proactive approach to address this challenge. She believes that technology, when used thoughtfully, can enhance lives and well-being.

The goal is to provide SocialTech Enterprises with data-informed insights and actionable recommendations that _will enable the company to create and maintain an online environment that promotes better mental health and well-being among its users_.

I used Python to process and visualize the data.

*The dataset lacks predefined intervals for categorizing scores into mild, moderate, or severe categories based on the total score. To provide clarity, I will designate scores below 20 as mild, scores from 21 to 40 as moderate, and scores from 41 to 60 as severe.
