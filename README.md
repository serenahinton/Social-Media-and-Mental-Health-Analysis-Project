# Social Media Analysis: Google Data Analytics Certification Capstone Project

The Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone project is a case study. The program offered two tracks that offered either a case study provided by the program or the option to create our own. I created my own since this was my first project and I wanted the practice. This is a mock scenario and a made-up company.

The project covers each step of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.

## Scenario

You are a junior data analyst and have been asked to lead a project for a brand new client - this will involve everything from defining the business task all the way through presenting your data-driven recommendations. You will choose the topic, ask the right questions, identify a dataset and ensure its integrity, conduct analysis, create compelling data visualizations, and prepare a presentation.
